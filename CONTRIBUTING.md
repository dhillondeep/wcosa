# Development Setup
Make sure necessary dependencies are installed as described in the readme. Make a fork of the repo and clone it:

```bash
git clone --recursive [URL to fork].git
```

You will need to install development dependencies
```bash
pip install setuptools-markdown
```

Then run `python setup.py develop`. You can also do development in a `virtualenv`.
