# Waterloop Cosa

Waterloop Cosa is a commandline tool used to help create, build, and upload AVR projects built using Cosa, an object-oriented platform for Arduino. This project is built on top of 
[arduino-cmake](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake) to provide a CMake toolchain for Cosa,
and wrapped in a Python script.

## Cosa

[Cosa](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa) boasts better performance and lower power consumption, while more powerful but complex than standard Arduino libraries. Cosa, being object oriented integrates well with other C++ program written in OOP style.

## Wcosa -> Wio
This project was used to known as `wcosa` but, our team had decided to completely rewamp the project
and hence change the name to `wio`. `wio` is under development right now now and when it is ready, it
will replace the old tool. Please stay tuned as development progresses
