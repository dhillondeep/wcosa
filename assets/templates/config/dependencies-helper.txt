# "dependencies" tag allows user to include other wio packages into their project. Dependencies can be placed
# in vendor folder if these are local packages. Examples:
# dependencies:
#   # this is a remote dependency 
#   myLib:
#       version: ^0.0.1
#       dependency_flags: []
#       dependency_definitions: ["HELLO", "NOO"]
#   # this is a vendor dependency
#   myLib2:
#       vendor: true
#       dependency_flags: ["-fcompile"]
#       dependency_definitions: ["Vendor"]
