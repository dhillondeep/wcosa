# "dependencies" tag allows user to include other packages into their project. There is a package manager built into
# wio and you can make use of that by specifying packages in this tag. Dependencies will be a list of packages and
# you can specify different options for each of them. Following are some key points about this"
# - version is where you specify the version of the dependency (required only for remote packages)
# - vendor is a flag that specifies if the dependency is in vendor package or not (by default it is false)
# - compile_flags are where you specify the compile flags for the dependency
# Example:
# dependencies:
#   # this is a remote dependency 
#   myLib:
#       version: 0.0.1
#       compile_flags: ["HELLO", "NOO"]
#   # this is a vendor dependency
#   myLib2:
#       vendor: true
#       compile_flags: ["Vendor"]
